I took a look at the 2023 Atlanta Braves and decided to find out some answers I had.  

Data took from the following sites:
https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search
https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/TBR/2022.shtml

I wanted to figure out questions about hitting, pitching, and specifically A.J. Minter

Please feel free to review, as this is my first query.  Tips and formatting assistance would also be very helpful.
